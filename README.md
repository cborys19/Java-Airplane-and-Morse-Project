Question 01- Airplane Seating Assignment
Write a program that can be used to assign seats for a commercial airplane. The airplane has 13 rows, with 6 seats in each row. Rows 1 and 2 are first class, rows 3 to 7 are business class, and rows 8 to 13 are economy class. Your program prompts the user to
enter the following information:
  a.	Ticket type (first class, business class, or economy class)
  b.	Desired seat

Here, * indicates that the seat is available; X indicates that the seat has been assigned. Make this a menu-driven program; show the user’s choices and allow the user to make the appropriate choices. Your program must use 2D array and the following methods:
  •	A method to initialize the seats
  •	A method to show the menu
  •	A method to assign a seat
  •	A method to show the seat assignments

In addition, your program must validate all users’ inputs such as wrong row or column number or if a seat is not available.

Question 02 - Morse Code
Perhaps the most famous of all coding schemes is the Morse code, developed by Samuel Morse in 1832 for use with the telegraph system. The Morse code assigns a series of dots and dashes to each letter of the alphabet and each digit. The international version of the Morse code appears in the below figure.

Your program must have at least a method to convert normal text to Morse code and a method to decode Morse code letter.
